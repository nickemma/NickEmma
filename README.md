## 👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas Emmanuel — **Distributed Systems Engineer**. 

## 🏥**About Me**  
I architect fault-tolerant systems that scale across regions—from consensus protocols to geo-distributed platforms to real-time event streaming. My work is grounded in the belief that technology should serve humanity, and that engineering excellence is an expression of purpose.

## **🚀 MY EVOLUTION**  
Full-Stack Development → Backend Systems → DevOps/Infrastructure → Distributed Systems Engineering (next: MS in Distributed Systems)

Each step taught me a different layer. Now I see the full picture: from user interaction → backend logic → infrastructure → distributed coordination → consensus. My strength lies in architecting systems that handle failures gracefully and work seamlessly across continents.

## **💡 Technical Arsenal**  
- **Core Languages**: Go, Rust, Python — Building systems that scale and never stop
- **Distributed Systems**: Raft consensus, leader election, replication, partitioning, CAP theorem
- **Infrastructure & Cloud**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS, GCP — Multi-region orchestration
- **Data & Messaging**:Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Cluster, PostgreSQL — Event-driven architectures
- **DevOps Excellence**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing, Observability, Security-first design

## 🎯 ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY
*"I believe good engineering is an act of service. Build systems that handle failures gracefully, scale responsibly, maintain consistency across regions, and solve real problems."*

The future belongs to engineers who understand distributed systems — creating infrastructure that not only runs at scale but also runs reliably, consistently, and with strong guarantees even when things fail.

## 📚 CURRENT RESEARCH
- MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems course (implementing Raft, distributed KV stores)
- Reading foundational papers: Raft, Paxos, Spanner, Dynamo, Bigtable
- Systems programming with Rust for performance-critical distributed systems
- Implementing consensus protocols from scratch
- Exploring CAP theorem implications and consistency trade-offs
  
## **🌍 LET'S BUILD FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS**  
Passionate about solving the hardest problems in distributed systems. Always excited to collaborate on systems that push the boundaries of reliability, consistency, and global scale.
