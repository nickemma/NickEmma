## 👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas Emmanuel — **MLOps Infrastructure Engineer**. 

## 🏥**About Me**  
Software & MLOps Infrastructure Engineer specializing in healthcare AI deployment. I address the critical question: "How do we safely deploy AI in healthcare?" by building HIPAA-compliant MLOps pipelines, secure cloud infrastructure, and production-ready AI systems that enable healthcare organizations to transition from prototype to patient impact.

## **🚀 My Journey: From Full-Stack To MLOps**  
Started in the UI layer, followed curiosity down the stack—through backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and into the AI lifecycle. Now I architect the infrastructure that keeps healthcare AI running 24/7 in production environments.
